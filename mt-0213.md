  - Do groups come out in bursts/waves?
- Determine win states and lose states*
  - How is the game completed? How is it lost?
- Implement sound effects / music
- Title screen / user config features
- Multiple stages/maps (Warren Mall, Ridge Walk?)
- *Polish*

###### * means this task leans on design decisions

## For this week...

#### Art Goals
- Update ratios from 13x13 to 16x16 (where applicable) (tilemap especially!)
- Make sure sprites have clear pixel ratio relationships (make sure everything is easy to see)
- Work on assets for new features:
  - Sizeable tower range indication (white overlay [example](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/33932b13e9be18c7d2f8f3fa57afe73d32de4d5b/68747470733a2f2f6c68332e676f6f676c6575736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f70726f78792f3450774969723073467835714e444e39716c6e484863704a56496833415763354f767667616c703845395a32744774794337584566483659656f5744744d3867627665686836514278734936343138476357373369744b57596f6b515f4e54616d52614f35783764))
  - Special particle FX, or **[GAME JUICE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=216_5nu4aVQ)** (dust, sparks, explosions)

#### Programming Goals
- Last quarter, we had **Map UI**, **Tower**, and **Enemy** teams...

- MAP UI
  - Selecting/deselecting towers
  - Map placement collision (towers can't overlap with trees, walls, etc)
- GAMEPLAY
  - Research navigation solutions for enemies ([NavMesh Agents](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/nav-CreateNavMeshAgent.html) may help)
  - Read up on the Enemy.cs and Tower.cs comments (it's short I promise)
  - Try to keep any changes you make to these scripts *in a separate branch*! So we don't overwrite things...

Thanks for reading!

Next meeting:
> Room 1040: Geisel 1st Floor West
>
> **Next Friday**, 2/21, 4:30 PM to 5:30 PM
