# LibraryWalkTD
A tower defense game based on Library Walk at UCSD!

The game is about keeping as many students from getting to class as possible.
Students act as enemies, booths and flyer people act as towers.

### Notice 2.0
[03-09-2020] I will be putting a build together by the end of the quarter (the game loop is almost finished).
However, the project as a whole will probably be extended into next quarter if we want to polish it for a mobile launch,
so that we can make more levels/features if desired.

### Notice
[01-27-2020] Hi all! I'm happy to announce *Library Walk Tower Defense* will be be continued as a project for the Winter 2020 quarter! We'll be taking anyone interested in the project as well as last quarter's members.

As a note: the Unity project was giving us some technical issues, so the team was idle for a while. Just contact the new programming lead, Matthew (mattblawr@gmail.com) for inquiries!

## TODO:
- ~~Finish enemy pathing (waypoints) and spawning~~
- ~~Finish student booth (tower) prefab with shooting functionality~~
