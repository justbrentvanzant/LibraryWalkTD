# LibraryWalkTD
A tower defense game based on Library Walk at UCSD!

The game is about keeping as many students from getting to class as possible.
Students act as enemies, booths and flyer people act as towers.

### Notice
[01-27-2020] Hi all! I'm happy to announce *Library Walk Tower Defense* will be be continued as a project for the Winter 2020 quarter! We'll be taking anyone interested in the project as well as last quarter's members.

As a note: the Unity project was giving us some technical issues, so the team was idle for a while. Just contact the new programming lead, Matthew (mattblawr@gmail.com) for inquiries!

## TODO:
- ~~Finish enemy pathing (waypoints) and spawning~~ *MOSTLY DONE*
- Finish student booth (tower) prefab with shooting functionality
- Finish map tilemap
- Implement art assets into project
