# LibraryWalkTD
A tower defense game based on Library Walk at UCSD!

The game is about keeping as many students from getting to class as possible.
Students act as enemies, booths and flyer people act as towers.

### Notice
[01-27-2020] Hi all! I'm happy to announce *Library Walk Tower Defense* will be be continued as a project for the Winter 2020 quarter! We'll be taking anyone interested in the project as well as last quarter's members.

As a note: the Unity project was giving us some technical issues, so the team was idle for a while. Just contact the new programming lead, Matthew (mattblawr@gmail.com) for inquiries!

## TODO:
- ~~Finish enemy pathing (waypoints) and spawning~~
- ~~Finish student booth (tower) prefab with shooting functionality~~
- ~~Integrate art assets into project~~
- Implement enemy pathfinding (around towers)
- Implement new tower behaviors (petitioner, AoE attacks)
- ~~Determine game over conditions (health), score counter~~
- Finish map tilemap *Mostly done*
- Implement map drag+scroll
- Polish! (Menus, sound effects, music, table upgrades (?), etc.)
