#### Programming Goals

- MAP UI
  - Selecting/deselecting towers
  - Map placement collision (towers can't overlap with trees, walls, etc)
- GAMEPLAY
  - Navigation solutions for enemies
  - Keep score! Decrease health!
  - Try to keep any changes you make to these scripts *in a separate branch*! So we don't overwrite things...
